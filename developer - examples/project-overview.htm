        • We will create an application where we will bring the data of movies, TV series and books from an external database and save it to a developer edition org.
        • This is just a practise about Data Modeling, Integration, Scheduleable Apex and LWC. You can adapt the processes here to many topics in the Salesforce CRM.

        • First, we will create the necessary objects and fields.
        • Then we will create the classes we will use to fetch the data. We will use omdb and openlibrary as databases.
        • Then we will create the Schedulable Class required for the update every month.
        • Next, we will create Lightning Web components.

        • Movies
            - When you have a long-running method and need to prevent delaying an Apex transaction
            - When you make callouts to external Web services
            - To segregate DML operations and bypass the mixed save DML error

            - To start a long-running operation and get an ID for it
            - To pass complex types to a job
            - To chain jobs
        
        • Books
            - For long-running jobs with large data volumes that need to be performed in batches, such as database maintenance jobs
            - For jobs that need larger query results than regular transactions allow
        
        • Scheduled Apex
            - To schedule an Apex classes to run on a specific schedule
