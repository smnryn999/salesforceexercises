        • Lightning Web Components (LWC) are custom HTML elements built using HTML and modern JavaScript.
        • Lightning Web Components (LWC) uses core Web Components standards and provides only what’s necessary to perform well in browsers supported by Salesforce. Because it’s built on code that runs natively in browsers, Lightning Web Components is lightweight and delivers exceptional performance. Most of the code you write is standard JavaScript and HTML.
        • Lightning Web Components (LWC) are a fundamental building block in Salesforce's Lightning Platform for building user interface (UI).
