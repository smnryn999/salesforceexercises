      <pre>
        Off course, Apex offers multiple ways for running your Apex code asynchronously.

        • Future Methods
            - When you have a long-running method and need to prevent delaying an Apex transaction
            - When you make callouts to external Web services
            - To segregate DML operations and bypass the mixed save DML error
        
        • Queueable Apex
            - To start a long-running operation and get an ID for it
            - To pass complex types to a job
            - To chain jobs
        
        • Batch Apex
            - For long-running jobs with large data volumes that need to be performed in batches, such as database maintenance jobs
            - For jobs that need larger query results than regular transactions allow
        
        • Scheduled Apex
            - To schedule an Apex classes to run on a specific schedule

          // The email sending logic is executed asynchronously in a separate context, allowing the main transaction to continue without waiting for the email to be sent.
