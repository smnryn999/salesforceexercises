        Off course, Apex offers multiple ways for running your Apex code asynchronously.

        • Future Methods
            - When you have a long-running method and need to prevent delaying an Apex transaction
            - When you make callouts to external Web services
            - To segregate DML operations and bypass the mixed save DML error
        
        • Queueable Apex
            - To start a long-running operation and get an ID for it
            - To pass complex types to a job
            - To chain jobs
        
        • Batch Apex
            - For long-running jobs with large data volumes that need to be performed in batches, such as database maintenance jobs
            - For jobs that need larger query results than regular transactions allow
        
        • Scheduled Apex
            - To schedule an Apex classes to run on a specific schedule

      <pre>
        <span class="string">
        • What is Future Apex?
            - Future Apex is a feature in the Salesforce platform that allows you to run long-running operations asynchronously in the background. This feature enables heavy operations to be executed at a later time or in the background, so the user doesn't have to wait while the operation completes. It is particularly useful for scenarios like integrations, large data processing, or time-consuming API calls to external systems.

        • Considerations When Using Future Apex
            - Static Methods: Future methods must always be static.
            - Limitations: There are some limitations when calling future methods. For instance, a maximum of 50 future methods can be called within a single transaction.
            - Parameters: Future methods only support primitive data types or lists of primitive data types as parameters.
